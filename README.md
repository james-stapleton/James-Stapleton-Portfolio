# James-Stapleton-Portfolio

## Description

This is a webpage to host my personal portfolio. It has 3 main sections: an about me with a brief description, a work section with screenshots and active links to my deployed apps (and works in progress that are coming soon), and a contact information section with my phone number, email and github. 

The page includes links in the nav bar to traverse the page by section, images that link to external apps, responsive design that realigns elements when the screen size shrinks, my main project displayed most prominently, a recent picture of myself, semantic html elements in the code and some styling. It will continue to be updated as I develop new skills and complete new and exciting projects.
