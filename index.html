        <p>My name is James Stapleton. I'm 28 years old and living in Asbury Park, NJ. I currently 
            work full time as a bartender while also studying computer science full time. With the customer service,
            creativity, adaptability and leadership skills that I've developed in the service industry, I am
            looking to dive head first into a new career as a developer. I am excited for all of the 
            opportunites and challenges in my path as I learn something new every day. Below you will find 
            an ever-evolving sample of my most recent and most exciting projects. 
        </p>
